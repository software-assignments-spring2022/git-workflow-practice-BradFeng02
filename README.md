## why I thought it was interesting

I think this as interesting because it offers another point of view about monoliths vs microservices. From the slides, I assumed that microservices were just better than monoliths. But this article made me realize some of the benefits of monoliths, such as ease of implementation. It acknowledges the benefits of microservices, but now I understand that microservices aren't always viable or the best choice.
